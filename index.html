      For first timers, the name's Lucie. Some folks call me Miss Manette.
      I don't mind either way. I'm interested in the humanities and, more
      generally, the human condition, not as an academic, but as a living 
      breathing person struggling to find value through the maze of life. 
      (You may argue, as I might, that it is impossible
      to talk about the human condition without being spiritual.) And indeed,
      the force that draws me towards our common centre is none other than 
      the existential force that drives all us today to work to put bread on 
      the table, binds us to life, and motivates in us the resistance the 
      solicitations of suicide.
